  abstract={Text entry in virtual reality (VR) often faces challenges in terms of efficiency and task loads. Prior research has explored various solutions, including specialized keyboard layouts, tracked physical devices, and hands-free interaction. Yet, these efforts often fall short of replicating the efficiency of real-world text entry, or introduce additional spatial and device constraints. This study leverages the extensive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in context perception and text prediction to enhance text entry efficiency by reducing users’ manual keystrokes. Three LLM-assisted text entry methods - Simplified Spelling, Content Prediction, and Keyword-to-Sentence Generation - are introduced, aligning with user cognition and the contextual predictability of English text at word, grammatical structure, and sentence levels. Through user experiments encompassing various text entry tasks on an Oculus-based VR prototype, these methods demonstrate a 16.4%, 49.9%, 43.7% reduction in manual keystrokes, translating to efficiency gains of 21.4%,74.0%, 76.3%, respectively. Importantly, these methods do not increase manual corrections compared to manual typing, while significantly reducing physical, mental, and temporal loads and enhancing overall usability. Long-term observations further reveal users’ strategies for using these LLM-assisted methods, showing that users’ proficiency with the methods can reinforce their positive effects on text entry efficiency.},

abstract = {Current VR systems provide various text input methods that enable users to enter text efficiently with virtual keyboards. However, little attention has been paid to facilitate text revision during the VR text input process. We first summarized existing text revision solutions in current VR text input research and found that backspace is the only tool available for text revision with virtual keyboards with few mentioning designs for caret control. To systematically explore VR text revision designs, we presented a design space for VR text revision based on backspace and caret. With the proposed design space, we further analyzed the feasibility of the combined usage of backspace and caret by proposing and evaluating four VR text revision techniques. Outcomes of this research can provide a fundamental understanding of VR text revision solutions (with backspace and caret) and a comparable basis for evaluating future VR text revision techniques.},

  abstract={The task of inputting text within virtual reality has attracted significant research attention over the last five years. Less well explored is the related task of correcting inputted text when errors are made. This is despite the fact that considerable time and frustration stems from efforts to correct text. In this paper, we bridge this gap in prior research and explore efficient methods for supporting text input correction in virtual reality. We present a characterization of the types and frequencies of errors encountered when inputting text in virtual reality and an analysis of effective editing strategies. We also present the results of a user study evaluating the performance and usability trade-offs for several interaction methods leveraging the unique capabilities of modern head-mounted displays.},
